# **MetaX**

## Welcome to the gateway of the MetaVerse !

### This project is for the EthGlobal web3 jam hack by 0xProf | devs4eth

### This project will still be in development after the hack and will work together with the sponsors

### to see how to improve their tech and specialize in assistance and development of thier projects

**It is a streaming network and nft minting app where users**
**can clip part of a video and sell it as NFT on the platform**
**or as the team likes to call XFT**

### How to start up

- you can fork this repository or clone it
  for cloning:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/praise-eze/MetaX.git
```

then change to the root of the repository:

```sh
cd MetaX
```

Then you can run the following in the root of the repository:

```sh
npm install
```

this should take a couple of minutes but if it is succesfull it should
exit with code 0 and install a bunch of dependencies

if you are getting an error while doing this , try deleting the package lock json file and the node_modules already there on the failed attempt and clear npm cache by:

```sh
npm clear cache --f
```

we pass in --f to do this with force, if the message isnt clear, try googling the error message.

if you get no error, you can now start the application by running:

```sh
npm run dev
```

this should work just fine and open the app at local host, specifically port 3000.

# NOTE: this code is open source for the time being but when in production phase will be closed.
